Data with analysis codes- Code: all locations within 250 km have the same factor - Sp_Code: allows for locations within 250 km among species (Moscow can show up for Grass and Bighead), but not within species (South China and Guangxi can’t show up for Silver carp)There are two groups of locations where some locations are within 250 km for one location, but not another in the group. Eg, Guangdong is greater than 250 km from Sunchow, but less than 250 km from South_China (which was within 250 km for both locations). For the analysis these groups were all considered within 250 km, which allowed sample sizes to stay consistent between repetitions of analyses.
